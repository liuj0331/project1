                <p>If you're going to take the time out of your busy day to blend your shadow to perfection, you might as well smooth some eye shadow primer onto your lids to keep everything in place. 
                Amy Strozzi, who's worked with Rowan Blanchard and Aly & AJ, tells Allure, "I keep it closer to the lash line and fade it as I go upward so I have more flexibility to blend in the crease area.
                "Then let it dry for at least 10 seconds before moving on to the main event.
                Need a primer rec? Urban Decay's Eyeshadow Primer Potion is always a good choice. Allure editors also love Too Faced Shadow Insurance.
                Primer isn't required for pro blending, though. Many makeup artists, like Mario Dedivanovic, would rather skip it.
                Instead, he prefers to tap leftover foundation or concealer onto lids to give the shadows some grip.</p>

            <li id="list">Pick your tools</li>
                <p>Depending on which makeup artist you ask, you're going to get a different answer for what the best blending brush is. 
                Regardless, "flawless eye shadow blending is all about brushes," says Giselle Ali, who's worked with SZA and Cynthia Erivo.
                "You have to have the right tools for the job. You can never have enough blending brushes, but two is good to start with." 
                The key is to keep both of these clean. Don't dip these into your eye shadow pans. Instead, use a denser brush like the Best of Beauty Award–winning E.L.F.
                Beautifully Precise Eyeshadow Brush No. 201 to lay down pigments before blending.
                Ta swears by the Anastasia Beverly Hills A12 Small Contour Brush. Ali prefers the Sigma E40 Tapered Blending Brush.
                Strozzi, on the other hand, has a completely different list of essentials.
                For blending powders all over the lid, the M.A.C. 224 Tapered Blending Brush is her ride-or-die. 
                When focusing on the creases, she prefers the Smith Cosmetics 230 Quill Crease Brush. 
                For cream shadows and powders that are on the denser side, she reaches for M.A.C.'s 234 Split Fibre Eye Blending Brush because
                "one side is synthetic, which helps apply the product, and the other natural side is great for blending it out," she explains.</p>

            <li id="list">Start light</li>
                <p>This is Ta and Ali's everyday technique: First, taking the brush with densely packed bristles, you want to apply the lightest shade you plan to use on the inner half of your lids;
                    then you can add darker shades of the same hue as you move toward the outer corners. (Copious amounts of blending will happen in between. 
                    I'll touch on that in a second.) "Using the light as a transition color, you can add dimension as you go with the darker colors and tones and blend, blend, blend," Ta explains.
                    Ta also suggests using the same bronzer or blush that you dust onto your cheeks as one of your shadow shades. 
                    "It creates a cohesive and natural look," he says. Or you can choose to use just one shade all over lids, making sure to diffuse the edges of the shadow with some blending.</p>

            <li id="list">Put it all into motion</li>
                
                <p>After laying down the lightest color, you'll want to pause to do the actual blending before moving to the next shade. 
                Ta and Strozzi recommend sweeping one of your clean blending brushes in a windshield-wiper-like motion along the creases to soften the edges and diffuse the hue.
                If you're using more than two shades on your lids, you will repeat this step with every color you lay down on your lids.
                After you apply your darkest shade to the outer half of your lids, you'll want to use a different blending technique. 
                Ta recommends swirling your second clean blending brush in small circles along the outer corners, running the brush in a V shape along your creases and top lash lines.
                Pro tip on how to hold your brush while doing all this: Ali recommends thinking of your brush like a pen. "The closer your fingers are to the brush hairs, the harder the application will be," she explains.
                "Relax — move your fingers further up the brush and make gentle sweeping motions, especially when working with darker colors."</p>  
                

            <li id="list">Clean up mistakes</li>
            
            <p>Now that everything is seamlessly blended, you might notice that you got a little carried away and pulled the shadow out too far from the outer corners or have created a weird-looking shape. 
            Ta likes to touch up edges and buff away these mistakes with a damp Beautyblender. (I was surprised, too — I've honestly never thought about using a Beautyblender for eye makeup before.)
            Strozzi has another genius tip, too : Use translucent powder like a magic eraser. "If you feel you've overblended the crease and the shadow is now 'too big,' 
            use a clean fluffy brush (yes, another one) and some translucent powder to take down that top edge of shadow," she suggests.</p>
