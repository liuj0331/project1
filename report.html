                    This is a webpage for my younger cousins who just started doing makeup. My site included headers, 
                    at least five separate pages and each of them explains different parts of makeup. Each page connects
                    with each other. It supports multiple sizes of screens. Each page has its own stylesheet and the images
                    in the website are declared. Non-HTML resources, such as CSS files, images, and javascript files were organized.
                    It served out of port 8443 and displayed as expectations. My site has different font faces. It's clear that the titles
                    and the contexts were separate in it. It includes links to external sites.

                    Younger cousin A: "You can see garbled characters in some page. Most of the information are clear and helps me a lot with starting make up."
                    Younger consin B: "Clear with each points. Fits in even mobile devices. The page can be more beautiful."
