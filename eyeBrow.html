        <h2>5 Eyebrow Tips Explained Through GIFs to Help You Achieve the Perfect Shape</h2>
        

        <ol>
            <p id="text">Your method is extremely important when it comes to eyebrow tips, but so are the products you use.

                High-quality products usually only cost about $10 more than drug store items so it’s not even a huge splurge.
                
                Plus, these products tend to last a long time so you really get your money’s worth.
                
                That’s why under each of these tips, we’ve included the best products.
                
                From start to finish, this entire process should only take about 45 minutes max – as long as you don’t count the first step.</p>

            <li>Don’t Touch Them</li>
            <p>Most people over pluck their brows on a regular basis. Before they know it, they have thin sticks with a strange shape.

                Before completing anything on this list – wait.
                
                Give your brows about six weeks to regrow. Sure, you can pluck above your nose and eyes in the meantime, but for the love of all that’s holy, don’t mess with the shape.
                
                Let those babies grow in nice and full before you give them a crisp new shape.</p>

            <li>Start at the Right Time of Day</li>
            <p>Always shape and pluck in natural light since you can see all the hairs a lot better. Otherwise, you’ll end up checking your face out in the car mirror later wondering why you didn’t notice all those tiny hairs around your eye.

                Try to find a mirror near a window with lots of natural light shining through. A small standing mirror with a magnified option works great.
                
                This LED vanity mirror from Amazon is only $25 and it lets you view your face from every angle.</p>

            <li>Identify Your Brow Shape</li>
            <p>You need to figure out what you’re working with.

                Are your brows naturally round? Do they have a sharp arch? Do the hairs point in several directions?
                
                Once you’ve identified your brows’ natural shape, you can select a shape from the image above that will work best with what you’ve already got.</p>

            <li>Identify Your Face Shape</li>
            <p>If your face is long and oval, a straight eyebrow can help even things out. If your face is round go for a sharp arch to add some angle. Heart shaped faces can get away with curved brows.

                You want your brow shape to complement the shape of your face.</p>

            <li>Cleanse the Area</li>
            <p>Time to prep your skin for plucking.

                Plucking your eyebrows is somewhat of a surgical process – there might be a bit of blood involved.
                
                Apply some witch hazel or rubbing alcohol to a cotton ball to cleanse the area. You want everything to be nice and clean. You can also rub a fresh cotton ball over your tweezers and tools.
                
                T.N. Dickenson’s Witch Hazel is only about $4 and it’s a gentler alternative to rubbing alcohol.</p>
